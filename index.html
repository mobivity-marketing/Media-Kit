					<hr>
					<h4>re•cognition</h4>
					<p><strong>Transform how you use data.</strong> re•cognition is an AI-driven learning machine that uncovers patterns in the buying behaviors of your customers. re•cognition then leverages that data to suggest pricing optimizations, guide marketing campaigns, or communicate 1:1 with each customer to get them to visit more often and spend more.</p>

					<h4>re•ceipt</h4>
					<p><strong>Communicate in store.</strong> Every transaction is an opportunity to create another. With re•ceipt, you can engage your customers with a personalized print or digital message based on each individual transaction.</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>re•ach</h4>
					<p><strong>Communicate in life.</strong> You need to re•ach your customers as they go about their lives in a place they’re sure to hear you. The average consumer checks their phone every few minutes, and with re•ach, you can send targeted, personalized messages to motivate consumers to choose you.</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>re•up</h4>

					<hr>
					<h4>re•currency</h4>
					<p><strong>Reward Incentive.</strong> re•currency moves beyond a simple platform, and is a blockchain based customer rewards currency that gives your customers the incentive they need to act. re•currency enables you to drive the buying behaviors you want, by giving more rewards for a specific product promoted by your partners, or for consumers who spend more than the average amount.
