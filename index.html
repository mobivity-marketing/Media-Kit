					<hr>
					<h4>SmartAnalytics</h4>
					<p>SmartAnalytics is a POS-independent platform that allows brands, agencies, and franchisees to quickly and easily unlock key sales data, in real-time. Customers’ expectations are changing and marketing today means being more relevant, more timely, and more aware of what’s working and what isn’t. SmartAnalytics unlocks the transaction data gathered by SmartReceipt, and transforms it into actionable reporting from the basket level through full organizations.</p>

					<h4>SmartScore</h4>
					<p>Typically, marketing focuses its attention on engaging the customer and trying to change their buying behavior. SmartScore allows clients to begin including, and rewarding, employee behavior as a key method to effect customer behavior and drive more revenue. By focusing on small changes - upsizing drinks, adding desserts, and promoting limited time offers - employees can have a dramatic impact on sales.</p>
