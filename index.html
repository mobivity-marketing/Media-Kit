					<h3>About Mobivity's re•currency Platform</h3>
					<p>Driving revenue growth for restaurants, retailers, and personal care brands is our specialty. The re•currency platform captures outcomes at the point-of-sale with precision detail, analyzes that data to execute strategies to increase revenue, and motivates consumers and employees to grow your business.</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>re•capture</h4>
					<p><strong>Gather your transaction data.</strong> re•currency begins with re•capture, which captures, aggregates, and stores transaction data for almost any point-of-sale (POS) system. This provides a clean, useful dataset upon which to predict and influence your customers’ buying behavior while delivering basket-level insights to your business.</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>re•cognition</h4>
					<p><strong>Transform how you use data.</strong> re•cognition is an AI-driven learning machine that uncovers patterns in the buying behaviors of your customers. re•cognition then leverages that data to suggest pricing optimizations, guide marketing campaigns, or communicate 1:1 with each customer to get them to visit more often and spend more.</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>re•ceipt</h4>
					<p><strong>Communicate in store.</strong> Every transaction is an opportunity to create another. With re•ceipt, you can engage your customers with a personalized print or digital message based on each individual transaction.</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>re•ach</h4>
					<p><strong>Communicate in life.</strong> You need to re•ach your customers as they go about their lives in a place they’re sure to hear you. The average consumer checks their phone every few minutes, and with re•ach, you can send targeted, personalized messages to motivate consumers to choose you.</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>re•up</h4>
					<p><strong>Motivate your employees.</strong> Your employees are a key asset in driving customer satisfaction, repeat visits, and upselling. With re•up, you can monitor, measure, and reward employees by team, shift, location, or region to better service customers, partners, and the goals of the business.</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>re•currency</h4>
					<p><strong>Reward Incentive.</strong> re•currency moves beyond a simple platform, and is a blockchain based customer rewards currency that gives your customers the incentive they need to act. re•currency enables you to drive the buying behaviors you want, by giving more rewards for a specific product promoted by your partners, or for consumers who spend more than the average amount. Reward your customers with the secure, flexible, and powerful re•currency.</p>
